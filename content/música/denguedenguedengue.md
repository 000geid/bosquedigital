## Overview

Consisting of Felipe Salmon and Rafael Pereira and formed in  2012, Dengue Dengue Dengue is  a Peruvian duo of electronic music.

### La Alianza Profana

Their debut album, **La Alianza Profana**, is a first approach to their now signature blend of cumbia and Latin American sounds, featuring promising and fresh ideas, but also a couple of caveats.

The album is sinister and ominous in tone, as depicted on its opening track, *Don Marcial.* Using a violent sub-bass, a microtonal main melody and agonizing vocals, the track uses black and grey colors on its depiction of a bleak background.

The album shines when it's nearest its cumbia influences:

* **Rayos Catódicos'** neurotic synthetizers dominate the bare-bones percussion and thick, layered bass

* **Chichón**'s melody, borrowed from 70s peruvian cumbia, blends almost seamlessly with the vocal ad-libs, and together they intertwine violently with the drum / bass marriage, leaving the listener as a mere observer of this clash.

The album, as i mentioned, has some really fresh ideas:

* **Rastakauboi** adds an eastern chord progression into the mix, which serves as the needed contrast to the dark tone of the album. The synthesis of the dialectics between a hopeful melody and an opaque background is a groovy, elegant track.

* **Como Bailar Cumbia** is a derivation of **Aphex Twin**'s Selected Ambient Works, with overlayed latin percussion, and ironic sampling of a cumbia class.

* The closing track, *La Alianza Profana*, is a cathartic feast, a *danse macabre*, celebrating its roots,and features perhaps the biggest success of the self-titled album: an interesting take on electrocumbia.

These interesting ideas come with perhaps my biggest issue with the album, filler:

- *Alpha & Omega* is a unexpected and unfitting throwback to 90s hip-hop. The most promising element of this song are the drowned, reverbed vocals, which appear in the middle of the song, but besides that offers nothing else.
- *Prende* could be a sides-B of *Simiolo.*

The core concept is there: serving peruvian cumbia (and a bit of chicha, too), and salting it with a wide mix of electronic influences. *Alianza Profana* is delicious, but could use a bit more salt.
